If you have broken bones or bleeding heavily, go to the hospital directly. These are serious injuries that require professional medical treatment. In short, if you’ve been injured in an accident, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Your health is always the most important thing.

                    Notify the police if the accident was caused by another party.

                    When you are in a car accident, you should do a few things to protect yourself and your legal rights. One of the most important is to notify the police if another party caused the accident. This will help to ensure that an official record is created of the accident and that you have a chance to seek damages if necessary. They have the right to file a report and will often be able to provide you with a copy for your insurance company. If another party did not cause the accident, you might still want to notify the police.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is especially true if there is significant vehicle damage or anyone was injured in the accident. By informing the police, you can create an official record of the accident that may be useful if you need to file an insurance claim or take legal action. In either case, exchange information with the other driver involved in the accident. This should include your name, contact information, insurance information, and license plate number. You will also want to get the same information from the other driver. In this situation, you should also try to get the names and contact information of any witnesses to the accident.
